Each folder contains a proof goal that is analoguous to the rule used in BitSet.key, as well as a completed proof file.

All proofs in this folder have been completed in KeY version 2.10.0.
This requires that Arithmetic Treatment is set to DefOps. 
The 'unsignedShiftRightJlongDef' rule has been adapted from KeY's 'unsignedShiftRightJintDef' rule.
Some of the proofs require manual intervention through the 'Cut' rule. We have provided the assertion that needs to be added with the 'Cut' rule.
