We have removed certain methods from the original BitSet file, and put the equals(..) method in comments. We then also added our JML specification to the code. This file can be found in the src directory. 
Using Eclipse extensions for KeY, we generated the stub files required by KeY. These files can be found in the java directory.
In order to load the proof obligations into KeY, select BitSet.key.

Most stub files have not been edited since being generated. The exceptions include:
java/lang/Integer.java: An unused specification has been given for numberOfTrailingZeros(int i) (hidden in comments & unused by KeY), as well as the method's implementation.
java/lang/Long.java: An unused specification has been given for numberOfTrailingZeros(long i) (hidden in comments & unused by KeY), as well as the method's implementation.
java/lang/Math.java: Contracts have been provided for the max(int,int) and min(int,int) methods.
java/util/Arrays.java: KeY's contract for Arrays.copyOf(long[], int) is used here. Original source for this contract: https://git.key-project.org/key-public/key/-/blob/stable/key.core/src/main/resources/de/uka/ilkd/key/java/JavaRedux/java/util/Arrays.java
